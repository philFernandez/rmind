# `rmind` reminder cli

---

-   ### Loosely inspired by [`task` warrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior).

-   ### The goal is to offer a less feature rich alternative.

-   ### Something for quickly jotting down and organizing concise ideas with user defined tags.

-   ### Ideas can later be recalled and filtered by tag(s) or as a complete list.

-   ### Using tags isn't a requirement, its just an option for categorizing ideas.

-   ### Harnesses the power of some of Python's best cli libraries to create a functional application that's easy on the eyes, and easy on the brain.

-   ### The idea is to focus on getting your ideas recorded and categorized without focusing on the tool you're using to do it.
